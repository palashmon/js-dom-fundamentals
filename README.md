# JavaScript & DOM Fundamentals

A good grasp of JavaScript fundamentals is very important if you are passionate about it. If you posses a solid knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, the only thing you need to get yourself familiar with when starting to work with a new framework is its syntax. The basic rules will be the same since under all the layers of abstractions. It is still just plain JavaScript.

We can look into some basic topics like:

- [x] ES6
- [x] Closures
- [x] Functions & Pure functions
- [ ] Functional Programming Basics
- [ ] Partial application & Curry
- [ ] Builtin methods
- [ ] Callbacks
- [x] Promises
- [ ] Ajax & server API calls
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Generators & async/await
- [x] Node & Express
- [ ] Lodash

### Motivation

I was motivated to work more on my JS skills more after reading this medium [post][post-link]. Some of the skill sets I already had and for others which I didn't knew or was not that confident about I started practicing more on them and tried to create a solid foundation each day.
