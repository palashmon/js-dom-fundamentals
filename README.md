# JavaScript & DOM Fundamentals

A good grasp of JavaScript fundamentals is very important if you are passionate about it.  
We can look into topics like:

- [x] ES6
- [x] Closures
- [ ] Functions & Pure functions
- [ ] Functional Programming Basics
- [ ] Partial application & Curry
- [ ] Builtin methods
- [ ] Callbacks
- [ ] Promises
- [ ] Ajax & server API calls
- [ ] Classes 
- [ ] Generators & async/await
- [x] Node & Express
- [ ] Lodash

### Motivation 

I was motivated to work more on my JS skills more after reading this medium [post](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711). Some of the skill sets I already had and for others which I didn't knew or was not that confident about I started practicing more on them and tried to create a solid foundation each day.
