/**
    Concept     :   Recursions
    Description :   Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a
                    function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.
    Usability   :   It allows for the construction of code that doesnâ€™t require setting
                    and maintaining state with local variables.
                    Recursive functions are also naturally easy to test because they are easy to write in a pure manner
